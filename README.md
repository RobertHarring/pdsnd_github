### Date created

### Project Title
Explore US bikeshare data with Python

### Description
This project is part of the Udacity nanodegree "Programming for data science with Python". In it, I wrote Python code to import US bike share data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Statistics computed
The statistics computed are:
- What are the most popular times of travel (month, week, day)?
- What are the most popular stations and trips (most common start station, most common end station, most common trip from start to end)?
- What is the total travel time?
- What is the average travel time?
- What types of users have rented the bikes?
- What is the gender count of the customers?
- What is the earliest, most recent and most commmon year of birth of the customers?
